# How to Release

1. Use `bump2version` to bump the version number.
    - If a minor / major version is needed:
        + `bump2version minor` or `bump2version major`
    - Then release the version: `bump2version release`

2. Edit the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
    - Change unreleased to the version number you are releasing.
    - Add `(YYYY-MM-DD)` date next to version number.
    - Add link to the full changelog. 

3. Commit and push the changes.

4. Make a release on GitHub (and create a tag). This will automatically upload the new package to PyPI.

5. Publish the new version on Readthedocs.

6. Use `bump2version` to create a new beta version: `bump2version patch`
